    <h2>BIO</h2>
    <p  class="bio"><img src="/images/myprofile.svg" alt="profile"> Jean Yves is an emerging artist from Haiti who has a deep love for plants, and animals.
        He is particularly drawn to the color green. Growing up in a rural area surrounded by lush greenery, Jean Yves
        developed a strong connection to the natural world at a young age. He spent his childhood exploring the forests
        and fields, sketching and painting the vibrant flora and fauna that surrounded him.</p>

    <p> As Jean Yves's passion for art grew, he began to experiment with different techniques and styles, always
        incorporating shades of green into his work. He found that this color not only represented the natural beauty of
        his surroundings, but also symbolized growth, harmony, and balance - all themes that were important to him.
    </p>
    <p> Jean Yves's artwork often features intricate patterns and organic shapes, inspired by the textures and forms
        found in the natural world. He uses a variety of mediums, including paint, charcoal, and digital illustration,
        to create pieces that are both striking and thought-provoking.
    </p>
    <p> Jean Yves's work has gained recognition in the local art scene. He has exhibited his artworks in several
        galleries and art fairs, where they have received praise for their unique style and vivid colors.

    </p>
    <p> As Jean Yves continues to grow as an artist, he remains committed to use his work to raise awareness about the
        importance of protecting the environment. He hopes that his art will inspire others to appreciate the beauty of
        nature and take action to preserve it for future generations.

<article class="about-content"><h2>ARTIST STATEMENT</h2>
    <p> My work is inspired by the interconnectedness of all living beings and the natural world around us.</p>

    <p> I believe that every person, every plant, and every animal has a unique and essential role to play in the
        delicate balance of our planet. By using the color green as a unifying element in my art, I seek to convey this
        sense of interconnectedness and highlight the beauty and diversity of life on Earth.</p>

    <p> Through my art, I aim to capture not necessarily the physical likeness of my subjects but essentially their
        essence, their spirit, and their unique place in the world. By incorporating elements of plant life, human
        figures, and animals into my work, I hope to remind viewers of our shared connection to nature and our
        responsibility to protect and preserve it.</p>

    <p> Working with the color green allows me to explore the many different shades and textures of this color, from the vibrant
        green of fresh foliage to the muted greens of moss and lichen. By layering and blending these tones, I create a
        sense of depth and complexity in my work, inviting the viewer to contemplate the beauty and complexity of the
        natural world.</p>

    <p> Ultimately, my goal as an artist is to inspire a deeper appreciation for the interconnectedness of all living
        beings and to encourage a sense of responsibility and stewardship for our planet. Through my art, I hope to
        promote a sense of wonder and awe for the beauty and diversity of life on Earth and to inspire others to take
        action to protect it for future generations.
