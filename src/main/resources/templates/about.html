<!--    <h2>BIO</h2>-->
<!--    <p  class="bio"><img src="/images/myprofile.svg" alt="profile"> Jean Yves is an emerging artist from Haiti who has a deep love for plants, and animals.-->
<!--        He is particularly drawn to the color green. Growing up in a rural area surrounded by lush greenery, Jean Yves-->
<!--        developed a strong connection to the natural world at a young age. He spent his childhood exploring the forests-->
<!--        and fields, sketching and painting the vibrant flora and fauna that surrounded him.</p>-->

<!--    <p> As Jean Yves's passion for art grew, he began to experiment with different techniques and styles, always-->
<!--        incorporating shades of green into his work. He found that this color not only represented the natural beauty of-->
<!--        his surroundings, but also symbolized growth, harmony, and balance - all themes that were important to him.-->
<!--    </p>-->
<!--    <p> Jean Yves's artwork often features intricate patterns and organic shapes, inspired by the textures and forms-->
<!--        found in the natural world. He uses a variety of mediums, including paint, charcoal, and digital illustration,-->
<!--        to create pieces that are both striking and thought-provoking.-->
<!--    </p>-->
<!--    <p> Jean Yves's work has gained recognition in the local art scene. He has exhibited his artworks in several-->
<!--        galleries and art fairs, where they have received praise for their unique style and vivid colors.-->

<!--    </p>-->
<!--    <p> As Jean Yves continues to grow as an artist, he remains committed to use his work to raise awareness about the-->
<!--        importance of protecting the environment. He hopes that his art will inspire others to appreciate the beauty of-->
<!--        nature and take action to preserve it for future generations.-->

<!--    <h2>ARTIST STATEMENT</h2>-->
<!--    <p> My work is inspired by the interconnectedness of all living beings and the natural world around us.</p>-->

<!--    <p> I believe that every person, every plant, and every animal has a unique and essential role to play in the-->
<!--        delicate balance of our planet. By using the color green as a unifying element in my art, I seek to convey this-->
<!--        sense of interconnectedness and highlight the beauty and diversity of life on Earth.</p>-->

<!--    <p> Through my art, I aim to capture not necessarily the physical likeness of my subjects but essentially their-->
<!--        essence, their spirit, and their unique place in the world. By incorporating elements of plant life, human-->
<!--        figures, and animals into my work, I hope to remind viewers of our shared connection to nature and our-->
<!--        responsibility to protect and preserve it.</p>-->

<!--    <p> Working with the color green allows me to explore the many different shades and textures of this color, from the vibrant-->
<!--        green of fresh foliage to the muted greens of moss and lichen. By layering and blending these tones, I create a-->
<!--        sense of depth and complexity in my work, inviting the viewer to contemplate the beauty and complexity of the-->
<!--        natural world.</p>-->

<!--    <p> Ultimately, my goal as an artist is to inspire a deeper appreciation for the interconnectedness of all living-->
<!--        beings and to encourage a sense of responsibility and stewardship for our planet. Through my art, I hope to-->
<!--        promote a sense of wonder and awe for the beauty and diversity of life on Earth and to inspire others to take-->
<!--        action to protect it for future generations.-->
